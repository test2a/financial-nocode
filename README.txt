this repo is supposed to be test ground for building a no-code solution to the issue of building financial statements in new format for non-corporates.
(https://resource.cdn.icai.org/70697asb56660.xlsx)[icai provided excel format]
The following are my goals as of now. I will modify them as and when things change and progress.

1. allow users to import data (csv or excel)
2. allow users to modify the report and see if the accounts are having any difference.
3. auto take depreciation, profit, closing stock and other heads and place them appropriately.
4. allow export of pdf.
5. allow showing schedules in separate pages as per the standard file.
6. allow adding footer/ title and other stuff to the format.
7. allow import of previous year data which gets moved to previous year and current year opening balances.
8. allow setting up organization so that we can record financial data of multiple orgs and multiple years.
9. allow users to modify the output as per templates.
10.allow users to export the result in software compatible format (various softwares like computax, genius)
11.add ratios so that while the preparing financial statements the user knows if there is any deviation.
12.allow user to define if organisation is individual/partnership/ngo/company and modify the format accordingly (like partner schedule)
13.allow proper PPE chart and depreciation transfer from there.

I have made this code from generative LLM's like claude/ openai/meta and i welcome any PRs.

you are free to modify the code.
